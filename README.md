# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It provides an engaging user experience with a clean and responsive interface, allowing two players to compete in a traditional 3x3 grid. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring compatibility across different web browsers.

## Features

- **Two-Player Gameplay**: Players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with "X" and "O".
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Win Detection**: The game includes a robust algorithm to detect winning conditions, highlighting the winner when three of their marks align horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- **Draw Detection**: If all nine spaces are filled without a winner, the game detects a draw and notifies the players.
- **Reset Functionality**: Players can reset the game at any time using the reset button, which clears the grid and resets the turn order.
- **Game Reset on Win/Draw**: A single "New Game" button is available for both winning and draw scenarios, making it easy to start a new game.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in a web browser.
2. Players take turns clicking on the grid spaces to place their marks ("X" or "O").
3. The game automatically detects and announces the winner when three marks align in a row, column, or diagonal.
4. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game announces a draw.
5. Click the "New Game" button to start a new game after a win or draw.
6. Use the "Reset" button at any time to clear the grid and restart the game.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structures the game board and message containers.
- **CSS**: Provides styling for the game elements, ensuring a cohesive and attractive design.
- **JavaScript**: Manages the game logic, including turn management, win/draw detection, and UI updates.

## Future Enhancements

- **Single-Player Mode**: Implementing an AI opponent for solo play.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeping track of wins, losses, and draws over multiple games.
- **Customizable Grid Size**: Allowing players to choose different grid sizes (e.g., 4x4, 5x5).
- **Improved UI/UX**: Adding animations and sound effects for a more immersive experience.
